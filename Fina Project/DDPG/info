DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that can be used to
solve continuous control problems, where the action space is continuous and high-dimensional.
DDPG is an extension of the popular Q-learning algorithm, which is used for discrete action spaces.
In DDPG, there are two neural networks: the actor and the critic.
The actor network takes the current state as input and outputs a continuous action.
The critic network takes the current state and action as input and outputs the corresponding Q-value.
The Q-value is the expected total reward for taking the action from the current state and following the policy thereafter.

DDPG uses a technique called deterministic policy gradient, which allows the actor to learn a deterministic policy
instead of a stochastic policy. In other words, the actor learns a function that directly maps states to actions,
instead of learning a probability distribution over actions.

To update the actor and critic networks, DDPG uses the same update rule as the Q-learning algorithm,
but replaces the Q-target with the estimated Q-value from the critic network. T
he actor network is updated using the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the action,
which encourages the actor to take actions that lead to higher Q-values.


In DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), the noise process is a technique used to add exploration to the action space.
Exploration is important in reinforcement learning because it allows the agent to discover new,
potentially better, policies that can lead to higher rewards.

In DDPG, the noise process is usually added to the output of the actor network. The noise is typically drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation that decreases over time. The noise is scaled by a parameter called the exploration factor, which controls the amount of exploration during training. As the training progresses, the exploration factor is gradually reduced, leading to less exploration and more exploitation.
The noise process in DDPG is important because it allows the agent to explore the action space more widely, which can lead to better policies. Without the noise, the agent may get stuck in a suboptimal policy that does not lead to the highest rewards. The noise process encourages the agent to take actions that it would not normally take, which can lead to better policies.

There are several types of noise processes that can be used in DDPG, including Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, Gaussian noise, and parameter space noise. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise is a popular choice because it produces temporally correlated noise that can help the agent to explore more effectively
